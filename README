What is FabriKokki?
-------------------
FabriKokki is an API between Fabric and Kokki.  It is hosted at Github at:
http://github.com/ssteinerx/FabriKokki

The purpose of FabriKokki is to allow installation of Kokki recipes on remote
hosts from within Fabric without the need to manually install and/or update
a Kokki installation on the remote system.

Whether this is done by replacing the Kokki installation mechanism, or just
hiding the machinery of Kokki has yet to be determined and really shouldn't
matter.

Bottom line: you can run Kokki recipes on remote hosts from within your
Fabric fabfile.py.  Be happy.

work.
