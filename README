FabriKokki is an API between Fabric and Kokki.

Fabric is a Python library and command-line tool for streamlining the use of
SSH for application deployment or systems administration tasks.

is at: http://docs.fabfile.org/

Kokki is a system configuration management framework styled after Chef.

Kokki is at: http://github.com/samuel/kokki

My Kokki fork is at: http://github.com/ssteinerx/kokki

My fork is much more likely to contain any changes to Kokki that are required
to make FabriKokki work.
