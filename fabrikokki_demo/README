What is This Demo?
------------------

This is a minimal FabriKokki demonstration.

It shows how to use FabriKokki in a real setup, with a real project to install.

It shows all of the needed pieces for a working setup.

Hopefully, this will be enough to get you going...

If not, please check out "Contacting the FabriKokki Team" in the main project
documentation.


Enjoy,
